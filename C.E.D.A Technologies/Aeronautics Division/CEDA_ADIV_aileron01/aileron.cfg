	description = “Sometimes, when using rockets is overkill and jets don’t respond fast enough for precise attitude adjustment, you need something to turn. With these, you can force the atmosphere itself to adjust your attitude. By redirecting the air as it flows over this lifting body, the force on the aileron is  transferred to the plane, allowing you to turn.
	Warning: requires an atmosphere. Warranty void if exposed to vacuum.
