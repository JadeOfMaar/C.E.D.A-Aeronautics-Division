	description = Planes need a method of staying aloft without power. This wing allows you to do so. By causing the air to move faster over the wing than under it, it creates a high pressure vortex that pulls up on the craft. The large size even allows a fuel tank to be installed in the wing, negating the need for bulky external tanks.
