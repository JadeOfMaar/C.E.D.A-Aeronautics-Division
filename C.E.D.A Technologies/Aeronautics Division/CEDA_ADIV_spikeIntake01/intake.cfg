	description = Initial tests of intakes at supersonic inlets were pretty, but destructive. Taking what was learned, C.E.D.A. engineers began to create this inlet. Using a cone to slow the airflow to subsonic speeds, this inlet allows optimum air flow above Mach one. Onboard software uses airspeed readings and pistons to move the spike forward and backward. This allows the inlet to maintain optimum efficiency as long as the craft is going at supersonic velocities.
