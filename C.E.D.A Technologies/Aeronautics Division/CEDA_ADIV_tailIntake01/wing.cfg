	description = Sometimes your craft has no easy place to put intakes. So instead of resorting to questionable methods of placement, use our tail intake! By sacrificing the control surface, C.E.D.A engineers attached an inlet to this tail stabilizer, allowing it to suck up air for your engines. The intake is optimized for subsonic flight, so it may not function above Mach 1.
Warranty void if flown over Mach 1.
