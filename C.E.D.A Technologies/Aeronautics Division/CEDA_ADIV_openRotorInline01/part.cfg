description = One day while our engineers were looking at a blender, they noticed that what was hit by the blades was pushed down. As a result, the idea for this engine was born. Using blades to push down on the air, this engine pulls the craft through the air. This engine is optimized for traveling at subsonic speeds, and rapidly loses efficiency as the speed approaches Mach 1. This is the inline version of the engine.
