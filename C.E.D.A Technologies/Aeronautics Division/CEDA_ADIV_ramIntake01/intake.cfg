	description = By compressing air funneled into the pipe, this intake allows craft to get large amounts of air to engines. The compressor works by funneling air pushed into the intake by the craft moving, so it uses no power. As a result of this passive system, you need to be moving to use it effectively, with higher speeds increasing the airflow to any attached engines. Your craft is moving, right?
